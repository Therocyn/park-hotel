# PARKHOTEL
This was my first "real" project using Java for my course of OOP, we(me and my college friends) tried to make a administration program for an huge park like Disney, etc. Actually the funcionalities of the program are pretty basics but it worked fine as an exercise.

## Making the program work
The easiest way to make the program run is by downloading [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), installing it and adding the  [Java Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack) on it.
After that you can download the full repository and put it on your VSCode Workspace and try to run the "src/Aplicacao.java" as the main method.
If you have some doubt you can enter in contact with me. This is a initial upload of the project so later i will put more work on it and in this "README".
