# PARKHOTEL
A administration software for huge parks like Disney, etc.

## Compilation Instructions ðŸ’¿

1. To run the code you need to download the [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk16-downloads.html).
2. Clone the repository:
```bash
[~]         $ git clone https://github.com/Therocyn/park-hotel
```
3. The path of the main class of the program is: ```./park-hotel/src/aplicacao/Aplicacao.java```
4. From now, you can either use JDK own compiler or an IDE (personally i like using Eclipse IDE) to run the exercises.
5. If you want to see the code, you can open the ```.java``` files using a text editor.
